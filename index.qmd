# nbis-course-quarto extension

This document showcases the
[nbis-course-quarto](https://github.com/percyfal/nbis-course-quarto)
extension. The extension provides two formats, `nbis-course-html` for
html documents, and `nbis-course-revealjs` for revealjs presentations.
The formats are tailored for creating NBIS course web pages and
presentation, and provide some custom formatting elements. Wherever
custom colors are used, they follow the [SciLifeLab visual identity guidelines](https://www.scilifelab.se/community-pages/resources/visual-identity).

For an example of the `nbis-course-revealjs` format in action, see
[pres.qmd](https://github.com/percyfal/nbis-course-quarto/pres.qmd).

## Usage

To use the html format, simply add to the document yaml header

```markdown
---
format: nbis-course-html
---
```

## Custom callout blocks

Quarto provides callout blocks for highlighting topics of interest.
The NBIS-course extension adds three additional callout blocks for
exercise content.

All blocks are formatted as fenced divs, with the syntax

```markdown
:::{.callout-NAME}

This is a special callout block.

:::
```

where `NAME` is one of `exercise`, `answer`, and `hint`. By default,
`exercise` is rendered unfolded, whereas the other blocks are rendered
folded.

### Example

The blocks can be rendered separately or nested within one another.
The following example demonstrates the latter case:

```markdown

:::{.callout-exercise}

The `ls` command is used to list the contents of a directory. What
option provides a so-called long listing format?

:::{.callout-hint}

Type `ls --help` to show the options to `ls`.

:::

:::{.callout-answer}

The `-l` option uses the long listing format, i.e., the command to use
is `ls -l`.

:::

:::
```

:::{.callout-exercise}

The `ls` command is used to list the contents of a directory. What
option provides a so-called long listing format?

:::{.callout-hint}

Type `ls --help` to show the options to `ls`.

:::

:::{.callout-answer}

The `-l` option uses the long listing format, i.e., the command to use
is `ls -l`.
